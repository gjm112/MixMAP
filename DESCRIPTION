Description: A collection of functions to implement the MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene
    level tests of association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a
    meta-analysis of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are detected as
    significant if the collection of p-values within a gene are determined to
    be collectively smaller than would be observed by chance.
