Matthews <gjm112@gmail.com>\nDepends:\n    R (>= 2.15.1),lme4,\n    Matrix,\n    methods\nDescription: This function implements the MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene\n    level tests of association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a\n    meta-analysis of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are detected as\n    significant if the collection of p-values within a gene are determined to\n    be collectively smaller than would be observed by chance.\nLicense: GPL-3\nCollate:\n    'MixMAP.R'\n    'MixMAPclass.R'\n    'plot.MixMAP.R'\n    'summary.MixMAP.R'\n",
