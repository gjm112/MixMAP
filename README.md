MixMAP
======

This package contains functions to implement the MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene level tests of association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a meta-analysis of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are detected as significant if the collection of p-values within a gene are determined to be collectively smaller than would be observed by chance.
